# Yandex Data Careers 2020 Readme:
## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing survey data from three code education websites, with an intent to describe the demographics of the field in 2020. Survey results are cleaned, transformed, and set into visuals with interpretation for the reader.
## Installation and Setup
Code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, where data from the three surveys is cleaned, organized, and turned into visualizations using Python. Pandas and Seaborn are used primarily for the tasks of organizing the data.
Results are provided in a presentation in PDF format.
## Data
JetBrains (https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2019/08/13/developer-ecosystem-survey-2019-raw-data-available/), Stack Overflow (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/), and freeCodeCamp (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2018-new-coder-survey) all conduct yearly surveys of programmers, charting the changing landscape in coding demographics. The JetBrains (JB) data is from 2019, StackOverflow (SO) data is from 2020, and the freeCodeCamp (FCC) data is from 2018. This analysis project was completed in 2020, so the provided results were up to date at the time.
## Packages Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
