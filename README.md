With the speed that technology, machine learning, and AI are improving and expanding, many fields are at risk of being left behind. A wide range of industries can benefit from these tools, if they only had the access. I aim to harness this power to magnify your manpower and allow for more innovation.

## About Me

**Katie began her professional life in the world of animal care. While her experience has ranged all over the zoological world, she has found a home in aquatics, managing the care of fish, stingrays, sharks and more. It was this field, coupled with an earlier interest in both statistics and programming, which led her into the field of data science. Now, when presented with a large dataset, she sees only possibilities and new discoveries.**

**With her extensive experience and training in science interpretation, she can break down complex situations into digestible ideas for those outside the field. Creative thinking in previous positions keeps her mind open to new approaches to problems, and stems from an insatiable need to find solutions.**

## Education

* BA Zoology, Michigan State University, 2011
